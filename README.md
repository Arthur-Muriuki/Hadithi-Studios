Photography is not only about pictures, it’s about capturing moments that tell a story.
“whether it’s the joy of a wedding, the energy of a graduation ceremony or the beautiful smiles at the corporate award ceremonies” – every session becomes part of someone’s personal story.
So this app isn’t just a booking system, it’s a story telling platform. A digital doorway where people come in with ideas and walk out with memories they’ll hold forever.


This project contains the source code for the Hadithi1studi0s Android application, developed with Kotlin and Gradle, and designed for private use within the company.
